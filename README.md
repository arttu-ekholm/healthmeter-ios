# HealthMeter

Get a push notification when your resting heart is elevated.

## About

HealthMeter monitors the resting heart rate (RHR) from HealthKit and sends a push notification when it's above the average.

## Why
I created this application for three reasons:
1. To improve my skills with SwiftUI & MVVM architecture
2. To see how well can tests be written for an app using HealthKit 

## External dependencies
This project has only SwiftLint as an external dependency. It isn't necessary.
